### 1. Overview
This guide contains in depth information about the transition from Windows to Linux, specifically [Linux Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com).

Users switch to Linux for many reasons, including concerns with Windows and Microsoft that might make a person want to switch to on open source OS like Linux. However, before committing to a new operating system, you should understand the essential differences between Windows and Linux.

In this guide you will learn the differences between Windows and Linux, as well as how to install and start using Linux as a current Windows user.

#### 1.1 Limitations of Windows

Windows is a closed-source operating system developed by Microsoft. While Windows can be downloaded and used for free, any customization or personalization of the system is locked behind a $140 license. This license is also needed to receive security updates and patches, meaning protection in Windows is locked behind a pay wall.

Windows has been known for having questionable security practices. The built in anti-virus, [Windows Defender](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/comprehensive-security), is known for not being the most effective, and security analysts recommend downloading 3rd-party anti-virus software such as [MalwareBytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com). The popularity of Windows has made it a common target for numerous cyber attacks, including [WannaCry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack) and [EternalRocks](https://www.varonis.com/blog/eternalrocks).

Being closed sourced means limited customization and transparency. Users cannot customize OS level displays like the File Explorer, while they also can't verify how Windows handles their data and privacy. In recent updates, Microsoft added [Copilot Vision](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/using-copilot-vision-with-microsoft-copilot-3c67686f-fa97-40f6-8a3e-0e45265d425f) which allows the Copilot AI to view your screen. While Microsoft says Copilot follows correct data collecting protocols, Windows users cannot properly check and confirm Windows did not take any shortcuts.

#### 1.2 Benefits of Linux
Unlike Windows, Linux gives users a lot more freedom along with more security. Linux is open source, meaning all of the source code is available to the public. This allows many benefits for users, such as the ability to "fork" code and have people create their own version of Linux more suited for certain aspects the user desires. With countless distributions, Linux offers a very customizable experience for whoever is willing to try it out.

Because of the open-source aspect, Linux can be somewhat confusing for those just starting out, but luckily there is a very active community that loves to help others get started. If you wish to get involved in this section of Linux, it is highly recommended to check out the [Linux Forum](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/), where you'll be able to ask questions and get answers from more experienced users.

Another great benefit of Linux is that it has extremely efficient performance, meaning it can run on really old or less powerful devices, making it a great choice for those with old devices looking to extend their lifespan, or simply those that want their operating system to take up less processing power. Along with efficient performance, Linux is also known for its reliability, almost never needing updates or restarts like other operating systems. Along with everything already said, one of the best benefits of Linux is that it is completely free to download and use, without the need for a paid license like windows.


#### 1.3 Possible Negatives of Linux
Now like anything in this world, Linux isn't perfect. The main problem is that it is a fairly steep learning curve when beginning, but the great thing about that is this User Guide is going to help you out! And as aforementioned, if you have any questions that this guide does not answer feel free to post a question on [this Linux Forum](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/).

Another limitation is Linux's gaming compatibility. Most distributions are not optimized for games, meaning that Linux does not support a lot of games, and often runs them inefficiently when it can.

Another possible drawback is actually the amount of freedom the user has with Linux, as it can be fairly overwhelming, making them not know where to start. Yet again this is where this guide will come in handy, completely explaining the process to switch from windows to Linux, including downloading, installation, customization, and much more.
